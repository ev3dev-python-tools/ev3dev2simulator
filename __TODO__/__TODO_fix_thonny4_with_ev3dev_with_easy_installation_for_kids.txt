- fix thonny-ev3dev with thonny4 
    => NEED to update thonny-ev3dev plugin to work with thonny4 ( python 3.10)!!
    
    => note: works with any ev3dev2simulator because communicates with it over network sockets!!
       THUS separate from ev3dev2simulator 
       However in installation we want to include ev3dev2simulator !!

- make installation of thonny with thonny-ev3dev plugin with ev3dev2simulator easy
      
      First idea: portable install 
         So make portable install thonny4 => then choose right version because binary wheel packages 
             `-> https://github.com/thonny/thonny/wiki/DeploymentOptions
                  Since 3.2 Thonny will work in portable mode simply when being run from a removable drive. 
                   In this mode it keeps (almost) all traces of its work (configuration files, logs) within its program directory.
                   
                   NB! Always pay attention to the installation target directory in "Tools => Manage packages" and "Tools => Manage
                   plug-ins". Unless you are using a virtual backend, Thonny will install new packages to global user-site-packages even
                   when running in portable mode.
                   This will probably be changed in version 4.0 (#718). -> ?? check this
                   
          => don't need a portable install but a thonny with everything already installed in its installation package
              -> later installs may in user site installed!
              -> this way we can build binary wheels for python 3.10 ourselves (which are not provided on pypi)
                 and install them in the thonny directory!
                 => have working version without needed. visual c++ stuff!!
       
      Better idea:  make an Thonny installation with extra packages/plugins already added 
                    (don't need to be portable, because fine if all traces of its work are installed in the user directory )   
           
           CREATE: install Thonny and add with pip packages to the python version installed within the Thonny directory
             then zip the Thonny folder as  thonny-with-ev3dev.zip 
           
           INSTALLATION: just extract   thonny-with-ev3dev.zip  in your /Application dir
                         and this then just works!
