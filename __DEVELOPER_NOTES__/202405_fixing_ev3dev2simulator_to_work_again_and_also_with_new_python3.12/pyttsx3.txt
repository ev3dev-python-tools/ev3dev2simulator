SUMMARY:
------- 
    problems found: 
      1) pyttsx3 build broken on macos sonoma
         -> seems that the c library of the macos system has changed,
            and that therefore c-call to a system library by pyttsx3 fails!!
      2) py3-tts fixes pyttsx3 on macos, but still breaks on python 3.12
       
        
    solutions found:
      1) do not use pyobjc==10 , but switch to  pyobjc==9.0.1 
         do this by switching to 
            pyttsx3 -> py3-tts (requires pyobjc==9.0.1)
         note: the current latest pyobjc version is v10.1 (maybe later versions will work again??)    
           
      2) for mac:  pyobjc==9.0.1    ->  pyobjc==9.2  
           then no problems on python 3.12

    thus the solution is simply to just adjust the requirements to: 
      "py3-tts" 
      "pyobjc==9.2; platform_system == 'Darwin'"
      
      
    note: https://pypi.org/project/py3-tts/3.5/#files

           py3_tts-3.5-py3-none-any.whl
           
          => a pure wheel, because py3-tts
             use a third party python package (pyobjc on mac)
             to interact with os's local libraries
             
             note: /Users/harcok/Documents/help/programming/python/__BINARY_DEPS__be_CAREFULL__/__README__LIST_BINARY_DEPS__.txt
                  also shows pyttsx3/py3-tts is not a none-pure package
             
          => so we do not need to build wheels per platform,
             but single universal pure wheel suffices!        
          
          
          IMPORTANT: for mac/windows the used system 'speak' libraries are always available,
            but for linux you must sure these are installed with:
            
              sudo apt update && sudo apt install espeak ffmpeg libespeak1

       macos: 3.8,3.10 OK, an 3.12 OK if pyobjc==9.2
       linux: 3.8,3.10,3.12 OK

            Makes use of the pyttsx3 library.
            - Windows users need to install pypiwin32, installed by: pip install pypiwin32
            - Linux users need to install espeak, installed by: sudo apt-get install espeak
            - Mac users do not need to install any additional software.

         => just add that as dependency!!


dependencies:

testing gave 2 problems:
--------------------------

  1) macos sonoma problem:     
  
       pyttsx3 just fails building on macos sonoma
  
     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77605608/pyttsx3-runtime-error-in-vscode-running-mac-os-sonoma
   
       -> seems that the c library of the macos system has changed,
          and that therefore c-call to a system library by pyttsx3 fails!! 
          
       -> found that py3-tts fork of  pyttsx3 solves this problem:     
            found later that problem was with pyobjc 10 or larger,
            py3-tts fixes that by requiring pyobjc==9.0.1  (same fixed could be applied on pyttsx3)
            
            https://github.com/thevickypedia/py3-tts/blob/master/pyproject.toml
   
              dependencies = [
                  "comtypes; platform_system == 'Windows'",
                  "pypiwin32; platform_system == 'Windows'",
                  "pywin32; platform_system == 'Windows'",
                  "pyobjc==9.0.1; platform_system == 'Darwin'",              -> limits  pyobjc!
                  "six"
              ]
              
              note: pyttsx3 had dependencies (setup.py)
         
                  install_requires = [
                      'comtypes; platform_system == "Windows"',
                      'pypiwin32; platform_system == "Windows"',
                      'pywin32; platform_system == "Windows"',
                      'pyobjc>=2.4; platform_system == "Darwin"'        -> causes pyobjc 10  to be installed
                  ]
       
            
       -> advantage py3-tts over  pyttsx3 is that it also has more commits with improvements/bugfixes
        
    
       THUS:
             
             pyttsx3 -> py3-tts

        
  2) python 3.12 problem on MACOS:   build failed
       
     => found later that for python 3.12 (not for 3.8 and 3.10)
        it also has problem with pyobjc==9.0.1, but pyobjc==9.2 fixes it! -> py3-tts  guys probably didn't yet test on newest python 3.12
        --> so must be very carefully with using newest python -> package maintainers may not have catch up!!
          GOOD RULE: for stability never use latest python version, but one before!!
   
            
          CONCLUSION: even if you install an old compatible python version for older package with c-extension,
                      sometimes it still breaks because c-api in newer version of OS changes!!
                                                          `-> newer pyobjc 10 breaks it!!


        
        thus:  
        
           pyobjc==9.0.1    ->  pyobjc==9.2


        means in pyproject.toml for ev3dev2simulator we require:

            "py3-tts" 
            "pyobjc==9.2; platform_system == 'Darwin'"




CONCLUSION:    works for all platforms and python version if using  py3-tts instead of pyttsx3 
===========    and a minor depencency change for pyobjc on macos

working instructions 

    * mac
       requires pyobjc  python package           -> package which bridges c lib to a python lib
   
       instructions:
            pip install   py3-tts 'pyobjc==9.2'
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^
    * windows
       requires pypiwin32 python package        -> package which bridges c lib to a python lib
    
        instructions:
         pip install   py3-tts
       
           OK on 3.8, 3.10, and 3.12  
        
    
     * linux 
 
       install docs says requires espeak linux package installed on system
   
       instructions:        
         sudo apt update && sudo apt install espeak ffmpeg libespeak1
         pip install  py3-tts
   


 means in pyproject.toml for ev3dev2simulator we require:

    "py3-tts" 
    "pyobjc==9.2; platform_system == 'Darwin'"
     



background   python 3.12 problem with   py3-tts on MACOS
--------------------------------------------------------
                                               
  SOLUTION:  
      $ pip install   'py3-tts==3.5'
        -> requires newer pyobjc==9.0.1 which builds fine again on python3.8 on mac
          py3-tts==3.5 -> 3.5 is latest, can leave of 3.5, so in future can have compatible updates                      
   
      FURTHER TESTING:
  
  
        works for python3.8 on macos sonoma, however  NOT for python 3.12:        
         $ pip install   'py3-tts==3.5'     
          ERROR: Could not build wheels for pyobjc-core, pyobjc-framework-Cocoa, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects
            -> pyobjc==9.0.1 required by py3-tts problem installing
            -> latest is 10.2 and installs fine!
    
            pip install   py3-tts 'pyobjc==10.2'  -> gives install but gives same error as for pyttsx3
                                  'pyobjc==10.0'
     
                          
            pip install  py3-tts 'pyobjc==9.2' -> installs and WORKS!! with python 3.12.3 !!
            => so py3-tts  not compatible with version 10.0, but also not with 9.0.1 for python3.12 !!
               note: pyttsx3 required 'pyobjc>=2.4; platform_system == "Darwin"'
   
   
   
    FINAL SOLUTION:
        python3.8, python3.10 :   pip install 'py3-tts'
        python3.12 :              pip install 'py3-tts' 'pyobjc==9.2'
     
   THUS: 
        linux: 3.8,3.10,3.12 OK.     for 'py3-tts' 'pyobjc==9.2'
